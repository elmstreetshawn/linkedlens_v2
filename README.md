This is a javascript based algorithm that I created to help spot the patterns of current gen AI content. I created a corpus of data https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1duD6aFjIcLMOYbkBSJZxnuNHpRpqpzfFRDizV4wp6Co you are free to use. That is 50,000 prompted outputs from gemma, llama, qwent, deepseek and flux.1. What I was aiming to do here was determine the patterns to build a quick and dirty system to identify the slop I am seeing on linkedin. 

This led me to learn HOW much was there, and it also brought some botnets into my threads. Which sucked, but was super interesting to be able to determine how and where the bot was coming from and what the content it was creating looked like. 

So i create a system you can copy paste your text into that you think is AI, but I'm generally lazy so I ported that over to an extension and that is this :)

Just unzip it to a folder, turn on dev mode for chrome and then load an unpacked extension.

Hopefully this can help you identify the losers posting AI slop on your feed.
